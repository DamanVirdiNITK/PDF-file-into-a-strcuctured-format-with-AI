# PDF-file-into-a-strcuctured-format-with-AI

Project Breakdown
1. Extracting Text from the PDF
Since PDFs can contain text in different formats (digital or scanned images), we need to handle both cases:

Digital PDFs: Extract text directly using PyMuPDF (fitz) or pdfplumber.
Scanned PDFs: Use Tesseract OCR to recognize and extract text.
2. Preprocessing the Text
Once the text is extracted, it needs to be cleaned and preprocessed to remove unwanted spaces, special characters, or formatting issues.

3. Structuring the Data with AI
We use AI models (GPT-4, Hugging Face Transformers, or a fine-tuned NLP model) to:

Identify key fields (e.g., invoice number, date, total amount in an invoice).
Convert unstructured text into a structured format (JSON, CSV, DB entry).
Handle different document layouts dynamically.
4. Storing the Data
After structuring the extracted data, we can:

Save it as a JSON file.
Export it as a CSV file.
Store it in a database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.) for further use.
